When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

i guess the best working version of the program
so that other users will be able to comment on that version


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

since it look like few people can work on the same project 
you might want to have control on when to pull/push

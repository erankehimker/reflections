What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

i think because this coimmand starts collecting the meta data on the repository files


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

i thinks i makes it easey to see only the lgical changes in every commit
makes it easeir to look at logs and diff's
